DESCRIPTION
    NOTICE: This module and the Sub::Spec standard is deprecated as of Jan
    2012. Rinci is the new specification to replace Sub::Spec, it is about
    95% compatible with Sub::Spec, but corrects a few issues and is more
    generic. "Perinci::*" is the Perl implementation for Rinci and many of
    its modules can handle existing Sub::Spec sub specs.

    This module provides get_args_from_array() (and
    gencode_get_args_from_array(), upcoming). This module is used by, among
    others, Sub::Spec::GetArgs::Argv and Sub::Spec::Wrapper.

    This module uses Log::Any for logging framework.

    This module's functions has Sub::Spec specs.
